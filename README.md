This is to demonstrate my skills using the Angular framework. 

*create a basic Angular application and within this application, create a module that will have a textarea input. 

*Given a sentence is typed into the field, the module will calculate how many times each word is repeated in the given sentence and create a bar graph using css only showing each word and its usage. 

*The logic will also ignore the following words: "and", "the", "a/an‚Äù.

For instance, given this sentence is typed into the field:

The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses - behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights. - Muhammad Ali

The module would count all the words, ignoring and, the and a/an and create the graph with how many times each word is used.
